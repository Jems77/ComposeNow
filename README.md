In today's digital age, email communication plays a crucial role in both personal and professional  settings.  Composing  effective  and  impactful  emails  is  essential  for conveying  messages, building  relationships,  and  achieving  desired  outcomes. However, crafting compelling emails that effectively convey the intended message can be time-consuming and challenging. 

The project aims to address this challenge by leveraging cutting-edge  technologies  and  techniques  to  automate  the  process  of  email composition.  By  combining  the  power  of streamlit module in python,
natural  language  processing  (NLP)  and OpenAI,  the  project  provides  users  with  a  seamless  and  efficient  solution  for generating contextually appropriate and coherent email content. 

The project utilizes Streamlit, a popular Python library for building web interfaces, to create an intuitive and user-friendly front-end interface. Users can access the  system  through  a  login  and  signup  page,  
ensuring  secure  access  to  their personalized email generation functionality. The web interface provides a seamless and interactive  experience,  allowing  users  to  input  essential  details  such  as  recipient, 
subject, and key points. 

The primary objective of the Email Generator project is to develop a web-based application that automates the process of email composition, leveraging NLP, OpenAI and web technologies, with a user-friendly 
interface powered by Streamlit. The project aims to provide users with the following key functionalities and benefits: 
1. Automated Email Generation
2. Time Efficiency
